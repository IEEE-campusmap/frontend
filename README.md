# CrowdScope

CrowdScope is a React Native mobile application built with Expo and designed to offer Northwestern students real-time occupancy information of campus facilities such as libraries, dining halls, and gyms through crowdsourcing. This user-friendly app leverages real-time crowd ratings to help Northwestern students avoid the hassle of crowded spots. Plan your day with confidence and save time for what matters most.

# Problem Statement

Navigating campus life can be challenging when students encounter unexpectedly crowded facilities. Without real-time data, making optimal use of campus amenities becomes a trial-and-error process, leading to frustration and lost time. CrowdScope tackles this problem by providing timely, crowd-sourced occupancy information.
